    <h3>Audience</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <p>Our audiences are primarily families and group-based organizations. Our company is based off family values of growing closer as friends, families, and teams in a safe adventurous environment. Demographic will be people living within 45,000 and 500,000 annual salaries. Families who are looking for fun and an enjoyable time together, coming closer together. Group based organizations such as church youth groups or a company team on a getaway to build team skills and destress activities. Our site is a site for non-avid white-water rafters, or those who are of minimal experience on the river. Challenges for people on the page is some people will come looking for only equipment rentals which can cause some friction because we only will be doing guided tours, and making our site easy-to-use, and easy to set up reservations. Our site will be target towards people between the ages of 12-75, whereas age groups for our company will be between 4-80. Looking for an adventure and excitement but not looking to be put in dangerous situations. The part of the Snake River we raft is mildly slow, yet has some exciting parts. Running times and timing of the page will be during the early summer to near late fall. Imagery will be family friendly, scenic calm shots, and children and adults enjoying themselves.</p>
