      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is specifically those who will be in their backyards and spend time outside. Middleage and upper class families with kids, grandkids, and those who want social gatherings at their homes. Those that want to protect their families, allow people to enjoy their time outside this summer and not be impeeded by bug bites, specifically by mosquitos. Images will be focused on families and summer fun. They will be focused mainly on Kids having fun and playing outside, Women gardening and playing with their kids and watching their husbands play with their kids or work, and husbands/men mowing the lawn and grill looking very manly, happy, in charge, and powerful. But with Dad bods. Advertising will focus on women with families seeing as they will be the biggest response group but will also be rolled out to men in a more rugged work centered ad. Age demographic for our customers will be from 30-55. Manily married women acting as homemakers. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        What will happen when I have my property treated?: 

When you have your property treated by us, first we will set up an appointment. You choose the day. You choose the time. Our technician will come to your property, introduce himself and let you know what he will be doing. The serve takes close to 20 minutes and then takes about 15 minutes to dry on a nice sunny day. He’ll come to your door again, inform you about the treatment and let you know he has finished, accept payment, and set up a time for our next treatment in 3 weeks’ time. And simple as that you are ready to enjoy your outdoors to its fullest potential.
